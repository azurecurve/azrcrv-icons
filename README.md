# Description

Easily add an icon to a post or page using the `[icon]` shortcode.

For example, to display the note icon, shortcode usage is `[icon=note]`; 1,000 icons from the famfamfam Silk collection are included.

Defintion of icons can be found at [famfamfam.com](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/); a settings page also shows all available icons.

Custom cons can be added; if a custom icon with the same name as a standard icon exists, the custom icon will be used.

[Shortcodes In Comments](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/shortcode-in-comments/) can be used to allow flags in comments and [Shortcodes In Widgets](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/shortcode-in-widgets/) can allow them in widgets.

This plugin is multisite compatible.
